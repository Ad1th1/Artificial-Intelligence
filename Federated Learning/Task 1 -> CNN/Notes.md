  Pattern recognition is awesome
  
  Softwares Used
  1. Tensorflow
  2. Keras
  3. Numpy
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Jupyter Notebook
  
  MNIST Data set
  -> training set of 60,000 examples
  -> test-set of 10,000 examples
  -> 784 features per image
  -> each image is labelled with respective digits
  
  data = training(builds the system) + test set(check the correctness of the system)
  
  Training set
  -> used to build a model
  -> consists of a set of images used to train the system
  -> training rules and algos used give relevant info on how to associate input data with output decision
  -> system is trained by applying these algos on the dataset
  -> usually comprises 80% of the data
  
  Test set
  -> used to check whether system is producing correct output after training or not.
  -> usually comprises 20% of the data
  
  Jupyter Notebook
  -> powerful tool to present data-science projects
