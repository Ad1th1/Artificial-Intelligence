Federated Learning
  -> collaborative and decentralized approach to ML that allows for smarter models, lower latency and less power consumption while
  ensuring user privacy
  
  IID data = independent and identically distributed data = we sample from the same random variable each time
  
  non IID data = primarily used for federated learning because every user has different data
  
  stochastic = having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.
