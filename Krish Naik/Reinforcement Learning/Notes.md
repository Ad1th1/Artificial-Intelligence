- 3 types of ML -> supervised ML, unsupervised ML and reinforcement learning
- Supervised ML -> Labels -> Classification and regression
- Unsupervised ML -> Clustering -> Customer segmentation

- What is Reinforcement Learning?
 > - RL is well-suited for solving large, complex problems, such as supply chain management, HVAC systems, industrial robotics, game artificial intelligence, dialog systems, and autonomous vehicles. Because RL models learn by a continuous process of receiving rewards and punishments for every action taken by the agent, it is possible to train systems to make decisions under uncertainty and in dynamic environments.
 
  > - RL is based on models called Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). An MDP consists of a series of time steps. Each time step consists of the following:

  > - type of ML in which agent explores an environment to learn how to perform desired tasks by taking actions with good outcomes and avoiding actions with bad outcomes
  >  - An RL model learns from experience overtime and identifies actions that lead to the best reward
  >  - an agent interacts with an environment with the objective, being to maximize the total reward
  >  - agent takes action based on the environment state and the environment returns the reward and the next state. THe agent learns from trial-and-error, initially taking random actions that lead to long-term rewards


- agent embodies the neural network, taking inputs and decoding actions
- environment -> explored by agent to collect data to train the underlying neural network
- state = snapshot of the environment that the agent is in at any point of time
- action = move made by agent in the current state
- reward = score given as feedback to the agent when it takes an action in it's given state

Entities in Reinforcement Learning:
> - Agent : a thing or person that tries to gain rewards by interaction or a piece of code that implements a policy
> - Environment : model of world, external to agent. It provides observations and rewards to the agent
> 

- iteration
- exploration
