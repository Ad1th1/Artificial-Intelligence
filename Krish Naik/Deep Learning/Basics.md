- Machine Learning
  > - subset of AI
  > - statistical tools for analysis, prediction, forecasting and preprocessinG
  > - Supervised ML = |- INPUT -> ML MODEL -> OUTPUT |
  > > - independent(input) and dependent(output) feautures
  > > - regression problem => output = continuous -> forecasting, time series forecasting
  > > - classification problem => output = fixed category
  > > > - binary classification
  > > > - multiclass classification -> one output, many categories
  > > > - multilabel classification -> multiple outputs / labels
  > - Unsupervised ML
  > > - We don't know our output
  > > - Eg: clustering, segmentation, reduced dimension
  > - Semi-supervised ML = | labelled data -> models -> recommendation | -> | interaction -> model -> new reccomendation |

- Deep Learning
  > - Neural Networks
  > - has supervised, unsuoervised and semi-supervised neural networks
  > - ANN -> Artificial Neural Network -> input data = tabular dataset
  > - CNN -> Convolutional Neural Network -> input data = images / videos
  > > - image classification, object detection(RCNN, FAST RCNN, FASTER RCNN, SSD, YOLO, DETECTRON), segmentation, tracking, GAN
  > - RNN -> Recurrent Neural Network -> input data = text, time-series data, sequential data
  > > - RNN, LSTM RNN, Bidirectional LSTM RNN, Encoder- decoder, Transformers, BERT
