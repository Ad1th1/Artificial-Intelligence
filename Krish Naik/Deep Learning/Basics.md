  > - Supervised ML = |- INPUT -> ML MODEL -> OUTPUT |
  > >  independent(input) and dependent(output) feautures
  > >  regression problem => output = continuous -> forecasting, time series forecasting
  > >  classification problem => output = fixed category
          > - binary classification
          > - multiclass classification -> one output, many categories
          > - multilabel classification -> multiple outputs / labels
  > - Unsupervised ML
      > - We don't know our output
      > - Eg: clustering, segmentation, reduced dimension
