- ANN:
  - Artificial neural networks are usually organized in layers
  - dense or fully connected layers
  - convolution layers
  - recurrent layers
  - normalization layers
  

- Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages.
