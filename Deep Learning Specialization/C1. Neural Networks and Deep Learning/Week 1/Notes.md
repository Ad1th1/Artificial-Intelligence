- AI is the new electricity
- DEEP LEARNING

_________________________________________________________________________________________

- Neural Networks:
- Housing Price Prediction -> Simplest possible neural network
- Linear Regression
-  size (x) -> o(neuron) -> price (y)
-  relu function -> Rectified Linear Units
-  a large neural network is formed by stacking single neurons together
-  parameters affect your housing price model -> family size, # of bedrooms, zip code, wealth (x) -> family size, walkability, school quality (stuff in the middle) -> price (y)
-  every input layer feature is interconnected with every hidden layer feature.

- Supervised Learning:
- input -> output
  > - Eg 1: home feature -> price (real estate) -> standard neural network
  > - Eg 2: ad, user info -> click on ad ? (0/1) (online advertising) -> standard neural network
  > - Eg 3: image -> object (1-1000) (photo tagging) -> Convolutional neural network
  > - Eg 4: audio -> text transcript (speech recognition) -> recurrent neural network
  > - Eg 5: English -> Chinese (machine translation) -> sequence data -> RNN
  > - Eg 6: Image, radar info -> Position of other cars (autonomous driving) -> Custom / Hybrid neural network

- structured data -> tabular and organized -> computer interpretation is better at this
- unstructured data -> audio / images(pixels) / text(words) -> humans are better at this
