- Neural Networks:
- Housing Price Prediction -> Simplest possible neural network
- Linear Regression
-  size (x) -> o(neuron) -> price (y)
-  relu function -> Rectified Linear Units
-  a large neural network is formed by stacking single neurons together
-  parameters affect your housing price model -> family size, # of bedrooms, zip code, wealth (x) -> family size, walkability, school quality (stuff in the middle) -> price (y)
